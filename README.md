# Fashion MNIST Deep Learning Project

This project uses **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify clothing images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset**.

---

## Dataset

- 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- Grayscale, 28x28 pixels
- 10 clothing categories:
  - T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

---

## Project Steps

- Imported and explored the dataset
- Normalized and reshaped the images
- Built a simple **neural network** using Keras
- Trained the model and evaluated accuracy
- Visualized predictions and model performance

---

## Results

- Achieved around **90% accuracy**
- Visualized actual vs predicted labels
- Created a confusion matrix for clarity

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
